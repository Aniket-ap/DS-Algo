## Problem Statement
Given a function f(x) = ax2 + bx + c. You are given an integer P. Print the value of f(P).

## Input

The first input line contains three integers a, b, c - the coefficients of the quadratic equations.
The second line contains integer P

## Constraints:

0 <= a, b, c, P <= 100

## Output

Print the value of f(P).

## Example

#### Sample Input 1:
1 1 1
1

#### Output:
3

#### Explanation:
f(x) = x2 + x + 1
f(1) = 1*1 + 1 +1 = 3
