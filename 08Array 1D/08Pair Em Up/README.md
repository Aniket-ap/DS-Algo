## Problem Statement
Given an array of N elements where N is even. You have to pair up the elements into N/2 pairs such that each element is in exactly 1 pair. You need to find minimum possible X such that there exists a way to pair the N elements and for no pair sum of its elements is greater than X.

## Input
First line contains N.

Second line contains N space separated integers, denoting array.

## Output
Print a single integer, minimum possible X.

## Example
#### Sample Input
4

3 1 1 4

#### Sample Output
